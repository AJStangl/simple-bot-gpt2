Laura Elizabeth Arthur,

**I love you**

You are the most amazing, beautiful, and unique person I have ever met. In every sense of the world. Not just in
physical appearance or state of mind but in your very soul.

As I stand here, before all those who that we love, I wish to express my love for you and testament to the
amazing, beautiful, and unique person you are.

## Vow 1 - To Be Your Support and Your Strength

I have never known anyone as selfless or empathetic as you. You ensure the smallest gesture's of kindness are
returned in kind to providing your full support those who are going through the unimaginable hardships. Despite, what
you may have going (like your Bachelorette weekend) on you always make your best attempt to help those you love. Your
acts of kindness transcend any like I have known. You are my rock and constant in this world **and to that end**:

**I vow to be your rock, an unwavering bastion of support, ensuring you never feel alone in this world. That you will
always have someone by your side and a person you can count on. That may never feel alone and your acts of kindness are
received and met with equal measure. To support each of your own endeavours and passions to the fullest extent of my
being**

## Vow 2 - To Fill The Cup, Not Drain It

Laura, your mind and spirit are a constant source of amazement, inspiration and wonder. I have no idea how you do it.
And by 'it' I mean, _gestures around_, **orchestrating this**, or if I were to look at any album from any trip we have
taken **orchestrating that**.

Or even _how_ you can traverse any city you may or may not have been to, and get to at a specific location
precisely at 4:44 whiling filling the time in-between with things to do.

It's amazing, and I realize that is does not
come from a lack of work nor does any of `this`, or `that` happen by accident. It can be draining and overwhelming **and
to that end**:

**I vow to be make every attempt to fill you're cup, not drain from it. To do what I can, however I can, whenever I can,
to ensure that I am a source of replenishment, not a siphon to your spirit or drain on your mind. While I may never
truly capable of doing what you do, I commit the full force of my ability to you, and as we move forward together, as
one, in doing so make us stronger**

## Vow 3 - To Make You Laugh And Dance

Laura, You let me be myself around you. My weird, funny, always losing something self, and you do the same for me (
Without losing your stuff). As silly as that sounds its special and important. I can't imagine a world without Coop and
Pablo. Without our glances with our tongues out when trying to be serious. All the other fun and silly ways we can be
our real selves with each other, including silly dancing and singing. Free of judgment, full of laughs. There are very
few. To that end:

**I vow to always be your silly friend, to help make your life fun, filled with dancing and laughter, embracing each
unique thing we do**

## Vow 4 - The Tiny Cactus

I have had the pleasure of watching us grow over the years. Watching our passions and interests grow over time. How our
humor has evolved and intertwined. From our mutual love of New York City Financial and Legal Drams to the use of the
word `nice` any time a very specific number is referenced.

It reminds me our the origin for our symbol of love. `The tiny cactus`. What started small, the size of a dime, has
grown into a beautiful, thriving plant. Not without its own hardship and much like our own, it has overcome, persevered,
and continues to grow. Seemingly strong and resilient, it is a testament to the symbol of our love **and to that end**:

**I vow to be your tiny cactus, that continues to grow, becoming bigger and stronger with your love year after year. To
always believe and know you can do the thing. To embody the symbol of our love as we continue on this life together**
